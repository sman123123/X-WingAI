# X-WingAI
This is an adaptation of the 'Flying Solo' rules by FFG for the X-Wing Miniatures Game.
I didn't quite like the way theirs worked but I liked the ambitiousness of trying to create an AI to fly any ship as opposed to specific ships like HoAC. This is mostly for me to learn some more Python as well as HTML through Flask. Very likely won't be relevant to you.
